## first of all, write your operation system source code, such as boot.asm
## and then compile it into a bin file
nasm -f bin -o boot.bin  boot.asm

## then build a floppy file 
dd  conv=notrunc if=boot.bin of=myfirst.flp

## or img file 
## dd conv=sync if=boot.bin of=boot.img bs=1440k count=1 


## you maybe want to test and see your operation system in qemu emulation
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda myfirst.flp -boot a -m 64 -localtime


mkdir csdisdo
mv myfirst.flp  csdisdo  

## or: mv boot.img cdisdo/

 
## after install cdrtools: brew install cdrtools
## here is your first operation system called jw.iso
## you can burn it into CD
mkisofs -o jw.iso -b boot.img  cdisdo/
